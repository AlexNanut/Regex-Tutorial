## Description.
In this Regex Tutorial, we will explore the validation of the email address regular expression (regex) featured in this tutorial: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. The tutorial offers a detailed breakdown and explanation of each component within the regex, making the validation process easily understandable. By completing this tutorial, you will enhance your understanding of how the regex operates to validate and verify the entry of a valid email address.

# Overview

## The Challenge
In this challenge, you will apply the knowledge acquired from the tutorial to create a detailed tutorial on email validation using regex. The tutorial will encompass the following steps that were undertaken to accomplish this task:

1. Conducted a thorough literature review on the structure and format of email addresses.
2. Identified the necessary components that need to be validated in an email address, utilising information from peer-reviewed sources.
3. Created a regex pattern that validates email addresses based on the identified components.
4. Set up a GitHub Gist, following the instructions provided in the "Installation Process" section.
5. In the newly created Gist, composed a brief explanation of the regex pattern created for email validation, describing each component and its purpose in the validation process. This explanation was informed by academic sources and tailored for novice coders and other academics.
6. Shared the link to the Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex pattern.

**The Sources Were Consulted:**
1. W3Resource. (n.d.). JavaScript: HTML Form - email validation. https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php
2. Regular-Expressions.info: https://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html
3. Harvard University. (2022). CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/7/
4. MDN documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions

The sources offered valuable insights into constructing and utilizing regex patterns for email validation, as well as providing pedagogical perspectives on teaching regex to newcomers and academics. This knowledge was integrated into the development of a comprehensive tutorial that aimed to present an accessible yet academically rigorous explanation of email validation using regex.



## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```

## Usage Instructions:
1. Access the deployed GitHub Gist link.
2. Read through the introductory paragraph and summary.
3. Navigate through the table of contents to explore the different sections of the tutorial.
4. Read and understand each component of the regex pattern.
5. Apply the knowledge gained from the tutorial in your own projects.

## Installation Process:
**Set up a GitHub Gist:**

1. Sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you haven't already.
2. Visit: https://gist.github.com/ to create a new Gist.
3. In the "Gist description" field, enter a brief description of the challenge, such as "Email Regex Challenge".
4. Add a new file to the Gist by clicking on "Add file" and give it a suitable name, like "email_regex.md".
5. In your newly created Gist, write a brief explanation of the regex, describing each component and its purpose in the email validation process.
6. Explain how the regex can be modified to accept new requirements, such as uppercase letters or additional special characters in the email address.

**Share your Gist:**

7.After you have finished explaining and making modifications to the regex, save your Gist by selecting either "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" based on your preference.
8. Share the link to your Gist with others to engage in discussions about various approaches and interpretations of the regex.

By completing this challenge, you will not only enhance your comprehension of the email validation regex but also gain hands-on experience in setting up and sharing a GitHub Gist.

## Built With:

- GitHub Gist: [How to Create a Gist?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)
- Visual Studio Code

## What I Learned:
1. How to research and consult various sources in order to write my gist. 
2. Deployed my 1st GitHub Gist.
3. Built knowledge and comprehension of regex patterns for email validation.
4. Thorough breakdown on regex components.
5. Effectively communicate the regex usage and validation techniques.

### Continued Development:
1. Broadening the scope of regex patterns to cater to additional validation scenarios.
2. Generating tutorials on utilizing regex in alternative programming languages.
3. Enriching the tutorial by incorporating more examples and interactive elements.
4. Disseminating the tutorial within the developer community to gather feedback and make further enhancements.
